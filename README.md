## Untiy WebGPU Path Tracer

Yet another path tracer.

This one is built on top of Unity specifically targetting WebgGPU.
Path tracer is implemented in a compute shader.

This is a work in progress, it has issues and needs a lot of cleanup. I have a lot of
ideas for it, and will get back to it at some point.
